# The Great Escape - part 1

## Challenge

> Hello,
>
> We've been suspecting Swiss Secure Cloud of secretely doing some pretty advanced research in artifical intelligence and this has recently been confirmed by the fact that one of their AIs seems to have escaped from their premises and has gone rogue. We have no idea whether this poses a threat or not and we need you to investigate what is going on.

## Solution

Loading up the pcap file in wireshark shows a bunch of TCP communication along with a few interesting sections of data. The first thing that stuck out was an email sent by rogue@ssc.teaser.insomnihack.ch.

Ultimately though the key to solving this part of the challenge was found in an FTP-exchange wherein the user `bob` logged in and uploaded a file `ssc.key`:

`ssc.key` turns out to be an RSA-key that can be used to decrypt the TLS-traffic.

Wireshark allows for decryption of TLS-traffic. Insert `ssc.key` in **Edit -> Preferences -> SSL**

After digging through some of the now decrypted TLS-traffic I found the flag hiding in plain sight in an HTTP header.
